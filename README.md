## Augmented Reality mobile application

Created an AR Android application using Unity Editor and Vuforia SDK, that helps students understand and learn concepts with the help of 3D models, videos, and interactive elements deployed by scanning image targets.


Open the application and point the camera towards the image target to view 3D models and videos through the app.

Download google-services.json from your firebase console and copy it into the assets folder.
